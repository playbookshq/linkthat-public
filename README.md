# Building a micro-SaaS in Laravel

This repository is the codebase for the [Building a micro-SaaS in Laravel](https://playbooks.com/course/building-a-micro-saas-in-laravel) course on Playbooks by [@iannuttall](https://x.com/iannuttall).

## About the course

Getting started can be hard for a beginner. How do I set up my app? What features do I need? How do I deploy it the interweb?

In this course, we'll cover all of these questions (and more) as we build a very simple link-in-bio micro-SaaS using Laravel.

It's worth mentioning that simple doesn't always mean easy. We'll have some problems to overcome, too!

Using AI as a coding partner is the best way to get those ideas out of your head and into the world. Let's cook ðŸ”¥

## Installation

This project includes a custom installation script that streamlines the setup process. Here's what the `install.sh` script does in a nutshell:

- Installs required Composer packages
- Runs the custom `fresh:install` Artisan command
- Sets up environment (.env file)
- Installs NPM dependencies
- Generates application key
- Offers to run database migrations
- Configures project name and URL
- Offers to remove installation files
- Provides instructions to start local development server

To install, simply run:

`bash install.sh`
